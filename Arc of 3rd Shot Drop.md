To achieve the perfect 3rd shot drop, mastering the arc of the ball is just as important as the landing spot. If the ball is too flat, it hits the net; if it’s too high, your opponents will smash it.
Here is the specific breakdown for aiming your height:
The Apex and Net Clearance
The goal is to create a "rainbow" arc that peaks at a specific point to ensure the ball falls steeply into the kitchen.
 * Net Clearance: Aim for the ball to pass between 8 inches and 1.5 feet above the top of the net. This provides enough margin to avoid unforced errors into the net while keeping the trajectory low enough to prevent an easy attack.
 * The Peak (Apex): For the ball to drop effectively, it should reach its maximum height—roughly 5.5 to 6 feet—directly as it crosses over the kitchen line.
Why the Height Matters
By aiming for a peak of 6 feet over the net, you ensure the ball is on its downward descent as it enters the opponent's side of the court. This downward angle makes it nearly impossible for an opponent to "short-hop" the ball or roll it back aggressively, as they are forced to wait for it to bounce or hit it while it is very low.
Adjusting for Distance
Because the crosscourt distance is longer than the straight-line distance, you must adjust your height and power accordingly:
 * Down the line: Requires a tighter arc and slightly less speed (around 19–20 mph).
 * Crosscourt: You have more room to work with, allowing for a slightly higher arc and more speed (22–23 mph) to cover the extra distance.

# How to Return Better in Pickleball: The "3 S" Method

One of the most frustrating feelings in pickleball is watching your return float just a little too high or go a little too deep, 
giving your opponent an easy opportunity to smash it away. If you find yourself popping up balls or struggling to keep your dinks unattackable, you aren't alone.

For controlling your returns—specifically your dinks—comes down to one simple framework: The 3 S Method.

Mastering these three concepts will help you keep the ball low, control your depth, and stop giving your opponents free points.

## 1. Space
The first "S" stands for Space.

A major reason amateurs pop up the ball is that they get jammed.
When a ball lands deep near your feet at the kitchen line, your natural reaction might be to half-volley it or scoop it up awkwardly.

This often results in a weak, high return.

The Fix: You must create space between your body and the ball.
• Don't get stuck: If the ball is bouncing near your feet, don’t just stand there.
• Move your feet: Use a drop step (moving one foot back) or a shuffle step to clear space for your paddle.
• Why it works: Creating space allows you to contact the ball in front of you comfortably, 
giving you the control to place it softly in the opponent's kitchen rather than popping it up.

## 2. Swing Speed
The second "S" is Swing Speed.

Physics is simple: the faster you swing, the farther the ball goes. 
Many players make the mistake of using a fast, jerky motion even when they are just trying to hit a soft dink.
A fast swing speed sends the ball too deep, often landing right in your opponent's "kill zone."

The Fix: Slow it down.
• Soft hands: Your goal is to lift the ball, not drive it.
• Control the tempo: Consciously slow down your arm movement. 
A slow, controlled swing helps ensure the ball clears the net but drops immediately into the non-volley zone.

## 3. Size (of Swing)
The final "S" is the Size of your Swing.

Just like speed, the length of your stroke dictates power. 
A long backswing or a high, exaggerated follow-through acts like a launch ramp, pushing the ball further than you intend.
The Fix: Keep it compact.
• Minimal Backswing: You don't need a big wind-up for a dink. Keep your paddle ready and in front of you.
• Short Follow-Through: Avoid a long, high follow-through. Think of your swing size as "small to medium."
• Precision over Power: By shortening your stroke, you reduce the margin for error and keep the ball from sailing past the kitchen line.

# Summary
Next time you are at the kitchen line, remember the 3 S's:
1. Create Space with your feet.
2. Slow your Swing Speed for soft contact.
3. Shorten the Size of your stroke.

Apply these simple adjustments, and you’ll find your returns landing softly in the kitchen, neutralizing your opponents and setting you up for the winning shot.

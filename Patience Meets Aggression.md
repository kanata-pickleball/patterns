LOOKING FOR EFFECTIVE PICKLEBALL PATTERNS TO HELP YOU LEVEL UP? THIS KPC BLOG IS PACKED WITH ACTIONABLE ADVICE PERFECT FOR 3.5+ AND SEASONED PLAYERS ALIKE. TODAY, WE ARE FOCUSING ON ONE CRUCIAL AREA: THE DINKING PATTERN.



Patience Meets Aggression 


Dinking—that soft, controlled exchange at the net—is where many points are won or lost. 



The pattern focuses on three key elements: 

•	watching your opponent's shoulders for tells (like when they turn to slide over), 

•	leaning aggressively into the kitchen line with your nose over your toes, 

•	and keeping your chest upright to direct the ball's bounce upward. 

If your or your partner first attack doesn't land, don't force it—stick to the pattern, and an opening will come.

This will work because it turns dinking from a stalemate into a strategic setup. As someone who's analyzed countless games, I've seen how this reduces unforced errors. Next time you're in a dink rally, try it: lean in like you're about to pounce, and watch your consistency skyrocket.


The Dinking Pattern Summary: Attack the Out-of-Position Player

The first pattern focuses on creating an offensive opportunity from a neutral dink rally. We emphasizes reading your opponent's body language to know when to strike.

•	Watch the Shoulders: Look for your opponent's shoulders to turn. This is your cue to slide over because they are likely out of position.

•	Nose Over Toes: Lean in at the kitchen line. Keeping your weight forward allows you to be aggressive on the next ball. Or the left side partner should do it.

•	Chest Up: Avoid collapsing your chest. If your chest goes down, the ball often follows that momentum into the net.

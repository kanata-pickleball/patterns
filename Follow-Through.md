# Aiming with Confidence in Pickleball  
## Using Body Forward Movement and Elbow Follow-Through

One of the biggest myths in pickleball is that aiming comes from the wrist or paddle face.
In reality, consistent aiming comes from **how your body moves forward** and **how your elbow follows through** the shot.

This article explains why these two elements matter and how they work together to improve consistency.

## Why Aiming Often Breaks Down

When shots miss left, right, or long, players often try to fix the problem by:
- Flicking the wrist
- Steering the paddle face
- Slowing down at contact

These fixes may work briefly but usually reduce long-term consistency.

**True consistency comes from repeatable body mechanics.**

## 1. Body Forward Movement: The Base of Consistent Aim

Consistent aim starts with weight transfer.

### What happens when the body stays back
- Paddle path changes each swing
- Timing becomes inconsistent
- Direction becomes harder to control

### What consistent players do
- Start balanced
- Push gently from the back foot
- Let the body move forward toward the target
- Finish with weight on the front foot

**Key principle:**  
Forward movement stabilizes direction and simplifies timing.

## 2. The Elbow as the Direction Guide

The elbow is the steering mechanism of the swing.

### Common mistake
- Paddle leads first
- Wrist tries to control direction
- Elbow stays passive or locked

This often causes late contact and erratic aim.

### Correct pattern
- Elbow moves forward first
- Forearm and paddle trail naturally
- Swing feels smooth, not forced

When the elbow leads, the paddle travels on a repeatable path.

## 3. Follow-Through Confirms the Aim

Aiming does not stop at contact.

### Consistent follow-through
- Paddle continues toward the target
- Elbow extends naturally
- Finish is high and relaxed
- Body continues moving forward

### Inconsistent follow-through
- Swing stops abruptly
- Elbow collapses inward
- Paddle wraps across the body too early

**Rule of thumb:**  
Where the paddle finishes is where the ball wanted to go.

## 4. Why This Holds Up Under Pressure

Under pressure, fine motor control breaks down.
Large muscle movements remain reliable.

That is why aiming with:
- Forward body movement
- Elbow-led swings
- Full follow-through

Produces better results late in games.

## 5. Simple Practice Drill

### Forward-Elbow Target Drill
1. Choose a large target area
2. Hit at 70% power
3. Focus on:
   - Weight moving forward
   - Elbow leading the swing
   - Smooth follow-through toward target
4. Freeze your finish for one second

Measure success by consistency, not winners.

## Final Thought

Consistent aiming in pickleball is not about steering the ball.
It is about letting your **body move forward** and your **elbow guide the swing through the ball**.

Bonus: Eye on the ball
 - When the ball is on your side of the court, fix your gaze on it and imagine burning a hole in it;  hitting the ball on the sweet spot of your paddle.
 - When the ball is on your opponent’s side, look for the available clues outside of the flight of the ball.

Aim with your body.  
Confirm with your follow-through.  
Trust the motion.

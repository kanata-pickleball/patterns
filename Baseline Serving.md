In pickleball, serve power comes much more from technique than muscle. Think smooth chain reaction, not arm-only strength. Here’s how it really works, step by step:

1. Legs & Ground Force (the biggest source)
	•	Power starts from the ground up
	•	Slight knee bend → push off the back foot → transfer weight forward
	•	This creates momentum before your arm even swings

👉 If your legs are quiet, your serve will always feel weak.

⸻

2. Hip & Core Rotation
	•	Hips rotate toward the net before the shoulders
	•	Core muscles (abs + lower back) transfer energy upward
	•	This is similar to throwing a ball or swinging a bat

👉 This rotation adds easy power without swinging harder.

⸻

3. Shoulder → Arm → Wrist (the kinetic chain)
	•	Shoulder leads the motion
	•	Arm follows like a whip
	•	Wrist snaps naturally at contact (not forced)

👉 Forcing the wrist early actually loses power and control.

⸻

4. Loose Grip (counter-intuitive but critical)
	•	Grip pressure around 3–4 / 10
	•	A tight grip kills racquet head speed
	•	Loose hand = faster paddle = more pop

⸻

5. Swing Path & Contact
	•	Low to high swing (required by serve rules)
	•	Contact slightly in front of your body
	•	Paddle face stable—not flicking wildly

⸻

6. Rhythm > Strength
	•	A smooth, relaxed tempo creates more power than swinging hard
	•	Power = timing + sequencing, not effort

⸻

Simple mental cue

“Push → rotate → whip”
